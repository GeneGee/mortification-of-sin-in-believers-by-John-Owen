Chapter 1 Romans 8:13 explained

The main foundation of this thesis:
The best believers, who are certainly freed from the condemning Power of sin, still need to 
make it their business to mortify the indwelling power of sin all their life.

The deeds of the body, "praxis", which, indeed, indicates mostly the outward actions, "the works of the flesh" as they are called in
Gal. 5:1. The outward deeds are only expressions of our inner self. We are to mortify the causes of the deeds of the flesh.

It is the constant duty of believers to mortify the indwelling sin still remaining in their mortal bodies, so that it will not
have the life and power needed to produce the deeds of the flesh.

When we are resurrected in Christ and regenerated, a principle contrary to the old man, one designed to destroy him, is planted
in our hears. But the whole process towards perfection (Christ-like behavior) is carried on by degrees all of our life.  

The vitality, power, and comfort of our spiritual life depends on the mortification of the deeds of the flesh. This is the true
meaning of "You will live", which shows the promise for fulfilling this duty.
